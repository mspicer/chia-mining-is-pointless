# chia-mining-is-pointless
Script to demonstrate how pointless it is to try an mine chia due to exponential growth in storage network. 

# To Do
- Adding live pulling of the current network storage size so calcs are 100% up to date.
- Build a web interface and graph over time
- Adding input for your storage setup so the results can be tailored for you
- Calculate resources being used by the network to dispell 'green' claims
- Calculate size of farmers setups based on rate of block reward
